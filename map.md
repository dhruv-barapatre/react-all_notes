# üöÄ React Learning Roadmap (2025 Edition)

## üî∞ Phase 1: React Fundamentals (Beginner Level)
üìå **Goal:** Understand the basics of React and JSX

* **Topic:** **Learn JSX**
    * Syntax, expressions (`{}`), attributes, embedding JavaScript logic.
    * Understanding JSX as syntactic sugar for `React.createElement`.
    * JSX Fragments (`<> </>`) for grouping elements.
* **Topic:** **Functional Components**
    * Component creation as JavaScript functions.
    * Props: Passing data down the component tree (read-only).
    * Component composition: Rendering components within other components.
    * Returning JSX from components.
* **Topic:** **`useState`**
    * State management within functional components.
    * Declaring and updating state variables using the `useState` hook.
    * Understanding state immutability and the setter function.
    * Reading state values.
* **Topic:** **Event Handling**
    * Inline event handlers.
    * Creating separate event handler functions.
    * Accessing the event object.
    * Synthetic events in React.
    * `onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`, `onKeyDown`, etc.
    * Preventing default browser behavior (`event.preventDefault()`).
    * Stopping event propagation (`event.stopPropagation()`).
* **Topic:** **Conditional Rendering**
    * `if/else` statements within JavaScript blocks.
    * Ternary operator (`condition ? true : false`).
    * Logical AND operator (`&&`) for short-circuit evaluation.
    * Logical OR operator (`||`).
* **Topic:** **Lists & Keys**
    * Rendering dynamic lists using `.map()`.

üìò **Mini Project:** Counter App, Todo App (with local state, adding, deleting, marking as complete)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 2: React Essentials (Intermediate Level)
üìå **Goal:** Build small apps with routing, effects, and form handling

* **Topic:** **`useEffect`**
    * Side effects in functional components (data fetching, subscriptions, timers, manual DOM manipulations).
    * The dependency array: controlling when effects run.
    * Cleanup functions: preventing memory leaks.
    * Understanding the different dependency array scenarios (`[]`, no array, `[dependencies]`).
* **Topic:** **`useRef`**
    * Accessing DOM elements directly.
    * Persisting values across renders (without causing re-renders).
    * Managing focus, controlling media elements, triggering animations.
* **Topic:** **Forms**
    * **Controlled Components:** Managing form state with React state. Handling `onChange` to update state on input changes. Binding state to input `value` prop.
    * **Uncontrolled Components:** Relying on DOM refs to get form values. When to use them.
    * Handling form submissions (`onSubmit`).
    * Input validation (client-side).
    * Handling different input types (`<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, checkboxes, radio buttons).
    * Managing multiple form fields.
* **Topic:** **Routing**
    * **React Router DOM:** Installation and setup.
    * `<BrowserRouter>`: Creating a router instance.
    * `<Routes>` and `<Route>`: Defining application routes and their corresponding components.
    * `<Link>` and `<NavLink>`: Navigating between routes.
    * `useParams()`: Accessing route parameters.
    * `useNavigate()`: Programmatic navigation.
    * Nested routes and layout components.
* **Topic:** **Lifting State Up**
    * Sharing state between sibling components by moving it to their common ancestor.
    * Passing down setter functions as props.
    * Understanding the flow of data in React.
* **Topic:** **Context API**
    * Avoiding prop drilling for deeply nested components.
    * `createContext()`: Creating a context object.
    * `<Provider>`: Making context values available to consuming components.
    * `useContext()`: Accessing context values in functional components.
    * When to use Context API vs. more advanced state management.

## üß† Phase 3: Advanced React Concepts
üìå **Goal:** Master hooks, optimizations, and reusable logic

    * Creating reusable logic by extracting stateful logic into custom functions.
    * Naming conventions for custom hooks (`use...`).
    * Sharing state and behavior across multiple components.
* **Topic:** **`useMemo` & `useCallback`**
    * **`useMemo`:** Memoizing expensive calculations to avoid re-computation on every render.
    * **`useCallback`:** Memoizing callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components that receive them as props.
    * Understanding dependency arrays for memoization.
* **Topic:** **`React.memo`**
    * Memoizing functional components to prevent re-renders if props haven't changed (shallow comparison).
    * When to use `React.memo` for performance optimization.
* **Topic:** **Higher-Order Components (HOC) & Render Props**
    * (For legacy understanding and working with older libraries).
    * **HOC:** Wrapping components to share functionality.
    * **Render Props:** Passing a function as a prop to share rendering logic.
    * Understanding their purpose and how they compare to custom hooks.
* **Topic:** **Error Boundaries**
    * Gracefully handling JavaScript errors in component trees.
    * `componentDidCatch` lifecycle method (for class components).
    * Static `getDerivedStateFromError` lifecycle method (for class components).
    * Creating error boundary components to wrap potentially failing parts of the UI.
