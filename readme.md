1. Prerequisites (Before Learning React)
✅ JavaScript (ES6+) Fundamentals

Variables (let, const)

Arrow functions (()=>{})

Template literals

Spread & Rest operators (...)

Destructuring (const {name} = obj)

Promises & async/await

Modules (import/export)

✅ Basic DOM Manipulation (document.querySelector(), addEventListener())
✅ Git & GitHub Basics

2. React Basics
✅ What is React?
✅ Install React with Vite (Faster) or CRA (create-react-app)
✅ Understanding JSX (JavaScript XML)
✅ React Components

Functional Components (Recommended)

Class Components (Legacy)
✅ Props (Passing Data Between Components)
✅ State Management (useState Hook)
✅ Event Handling in React (onClick, onChange, etc.)
✅ Conditional Rendering (if, ternary operator, && operator)
✅ Lists & Keys (Rendering Arrays in React)
✅ Component Lifecycle Methods (For Class Components)

3. Styling in React
✅ CSS in React

Traditional CSS

CSS Modules

Styled Components

Tailwind CSS

4. React Hooks (Core Concepts)
✅ useState – Manage component-level state
✅ useEffect – Handle side effects (API calls, event listeners)
✅ useRef – Access DOM elements directly
✅ useContext – Manage global state without prop drilling
✅ useReducer – Alternative to useState for complex state logic
✅ useMemo – Performance optimization (memoization)
✅ useCallback – Prevent unnecessary re-renders
✅ Custom Hooks – Creating reusable logic

5. React Routing (Navigation Between Pages)
✅ React Router DOM

Install: npm install react-router-dom

Setting up Routes (BrowserRouter, Route, Routes)

useNavigate for programmatic navigation

Dynamic Routes (/profile/:id)

Protected Routes (Authentication-based access)

6. Handling Forms in React
✅ Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components
✅ Handling Forms with useState
✅ Validation with Yup & Formik
✅ Handling File Uploads in React

7. State Management Beyond useState
✅ React Context API (Built-in Global State Management)

Creating & Using Context

Avoiding Prop Drilling
✅ Redux Toolkit (For Large Scale Apps)

Store, Actions, Reducers

useSelector & useDispatch

RTK Query for API Calls

8. Fetching Data from APIs
✅ Using Fetch API & Axios
✅ Handling Loading & Errors
✅ Using useEffect for API Calls
✅ Fetching & Displaying Data

9. Authentication in React
✅ Login & Signup Forms
✅ JWT Authentication (Login with Tokens)
✅ Protecting Routes (Private Routes)
✅ Role-based Authentication (Admin/User Panels)

10. Performance Optimization
✅ React.memo (Prevent Unnecessary Renders)
✅ useMemo & useCallback Optimization
✅ Lazy Loading & Code Splitting (React.lazy, Suspense)
✅ Virtualization with React-Window (For Large Lists)

11. React Testing (Unit & Integration Testing)
✅ Jest & React Testing Library
✅ Writing Unit Tests for Components
✅ Mocking API Calls in Tests

12. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Site Generation (SSG)
✅ Introduction to Next.js (React Framework)
✅ Differences Between CSR, SSR, and SSG
✅ getServerSideProps vs getStaticProps in Next.js
✅ SEO Optimization with Next.js

13. Building & Deploying React Apps
✅ Optimizing the Production Build
✅ Deploying on:

Vercel (Best for Next.js)

Netlify

Firebase Hosting

GitHub Pages (For Static Apps)
✅ Environment Variables & .env Files

14. Real-World Projects to Master React
✅ Beginner Projects:

To-Do List

Weather App (Fetch API Data)

✅ Intermediate Projects:

Expense Tracker

Blog App with CRUD

✅ Advanced Projects:

E-commerce App (Add to Cart, Checkout)

Social Media App (User Authentication, Posts, Likes)

Real-time Chat App (Using WebSockets/Firebase)
